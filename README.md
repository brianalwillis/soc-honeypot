- `Microsoft Azure:`</br>
  Core cloud platform used to build and host the SOC and honeypot infrastructure.

- `Windows 10 VM:`</br>
  Deployed as a honeypot to attract and monitor unauthorized access attempts.

- `Network Security Group (NSG) / Firewall:`</br>
  Intentionally configured to allow all inbound traffic to maximize visibility and expose the honeypot VM to real-world attack attempts.

- `Log Analytics Workspace:`</br>
  Centralized log collection hub for ingesting and analyzing event data from the VM and Sentinel.

- `Microsoft Sentinel:`</br>
  Cloud-native SIEM solution used to detect, investigate, and respond to threats in real time.

- `Kusto Query Language (KQL):`</br>
  Used to write custom detection rules, analyze login attempts, and visualize attacker behavior in Sentinel dashboards.

The objective of this project was to design and implement a simulated `Security Operations Center` (SOC) environment in `Microsoft Azure`, centered around a `Windows 10` virtual machine acting as a `honeypot`. The goal was to attract and analyze real-world unauthorized access attempts by exposing the VM to public traffic. Using tools such as `Microsoft Sentinel`, `Log Analytics Workspace`, and `Kusto Query Language` (KQL), I monitored, detected, and investigated threat activity. This project demonstrates core SOC capabilities, including threat detection, alerting, incident response, and visualization through workbooks.
